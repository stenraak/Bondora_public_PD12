### Predicting defaults within 12 months based on Bondora public dataset
#### Author: Sten Raak

The aim of this project was to create a predictive model in order to predict if a customer defaults within 12 months of starting a loan.

Here are all the files that I used for this project with one exception.
The initial Bondora dataset that I used cannot be uploaded here as it is too big, for this, please go to: https://www.bondora.com/en/public-reports to download the loan dataset.

The "bondora_project.ipynb" contains the whole code used in this project. You can run it from the start in order to see all the results. Make sure you install all relevant packages.

All the necessary packages are in the "requirements.txt" file.

I have added an EDA report as an HTML file that was I created using the "ydata_profiling" package.

"features.csv" contains all the relevant features that have been picked out from the 112 initial features from the Bondora dataset.

And finally I have also added the project report and presentation into this repository.
